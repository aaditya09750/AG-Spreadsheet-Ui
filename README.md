## Features and Functionality

*   **Interactive Spreadsheet:** Provides a user interface for creating and manipulating spreadsheet data.
*   **Cell Editing:** Allows users to edit cell values directly within the spreadsheet.
*   **Column Resizing:** Enables users to adjust column widths using a resizer component.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:** Implements keyboard shortcuts for navigating between cells, starting/stopping editing, and more.  Uses the `useKeyboardNavigation` hook for this functionality.
*   **Toolbar Actions:** Includes a toolbar with actions like sorting, filtering, importing, and exporting.
*   **Tabbed Interface:** Supports multiple tabs for organizing different sheets or views.
*   **UI Components:** Leverages Radix UI and Tailwind CSS for a modern and customizable look. Utilizes custom UI components in the `src/components/ui` directory.
*   **Column Visibility Toggle:** Allows hiding and showing of individual columns.

## Technology Stack

*   **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **TypeScript:** Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
*   **Radix UI:** Unstyled, accessible React components for building design systems.
*   **clsx:**  Tiny utility for constructing class name strings conditionally.
*   **tailwind-merge:** Utility for resolving Tailwind CSS class conflicts.
*   **lucide-react:** Beautifully simple, pixel-perfect icons.
*   **class-variance-authority (cva):** Utility for creating reusable component variants.

## Prerequisites

*   Node.js (version 16 or higher recommended)
*   npm or yarn package manager

## Installation Instructions

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aaditya09750/AG-Spreadsheet-Ui.git
    cd AG-Spreadsheet-Ui
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```

## Usage Guide

1.  Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev # or yarn dev
    ```

    This will start the application, and you can access it in your browser.  The specific URL will be output to the console (likely `localhost:3000`).

2.  The main entry point is `src/index.tsx`, which renders the `SpreadsheetStyle` component.

3.  Interact with the spreadsheet UI in your browser.  You can:

    *   Click on cells to select them.
    *   Double-click on cells or press `Enter` or `F2` to start editing.
    *   Use arrow keys, `Tab`, and `Shift+Tab` to navigate between cells.
    *   Drag the column resizers to adjust column widths.
    *   Click the toolbar buttons to trigger actions (currently logs to the console).
    *   Change tabs to see different views.

## API Documentation

There is no external API. The components are designed to be used internally within the React application.  The `useSpreadsheetState` hook provides the main interface for interacting with the spreadsheet's state:

*   `state`: An object containing the current spreadsheet state.
    *   `selectedCell`:  `{ row: number; col: number } | null` - The currently selected cell.
    *   `editingCell`:  `{ row: number; col: number } | null` - The cell currently being edited.
    *   `columnWidths`:  `Record<number, number>` - A map of column index to width.
    *   `hiddenColumns`: `Set<number>` - A set of column indices that are hidden.
    *   `activeTab`: `string` - The currently active tab.
    *   `toolbarExpanded`: `boolean` - Whether the toolbar is expanded.
*   `selectCell(row: number, col: number)`: Selects a cell.
*   `startEditing(row: number, col: number)`: Starts editing a cell.
*   `stopEditing()`: Stops editing a cell.
*   `resizeColumn(colIndex: number, width: number)`: Resizes a column.
*   `toggleColumnVisibility(colIndex: number)`: Toggles the visibility of a column.
*   `setActiveTab(tab: string)`: Sets the active tab.
*   `toggleToolbar()`: Toggles the toolbar's expanded state.
